This shortcut useful when that happens.\nImport your images, or use the shortcut on already imported images\nTo determine which tag you want, list all tags with exiftool: exiftool -j XE021351.RAF, and find the one you want to use.

If it passes all these tests it is returned to the caller. On non-windows operating systems a windows binary can be specified and the wine installation will be checked for the executable.\nIf an executable preference doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist or a test fails then an attempt is made to find the file in an operating system specific manner:\nunix or linux the user\u0026rsquo;s path is checked for a matching binrary using the which command macos first the user\u0026rsquo;s path is checked for a matching binrary using the which command if the executable isn\u0026rsquo;t found a search of the /Applications directory is performed windows the user\u0026rsquo;s path is checked using the where command if the executable isn\u0026rsquo;t found, then C:\\Program Files is searched for the executable if the executable isn\u0026rsquo;t found, then C:\\Program Files (x86) is searched 🔗RETURN VALUE result - string - the sanitized path of the binary, false if not found\n🔗LIMITATIONS it still can\u0026rsquo;t find GIMP on windows. GIMP on windows is installed in C:\\Program Files\\GIMP 2\\bin\\gimp-2.10.exe, if you use the installer from www.gimp.org. When check_if_bin_exists searches for GIMP it looks for gimp.exe. If the search was for gimp*exe then things like gimptool, gimp-debug-tool, gimp-console, etc. are found. Depending on who packaged gimp,there is an executable called gimp.exe which satisfies the search but is a GIMP launcher that exits immediately so the script returns and the image is not edited. Therefore, if you are a windows user, then you need to specify the location of the GIMP executable either from the Edit with GIMP script or using executable manager.\nflickering windows - on windows every command must run in a window, so every time a script uses a system command a window is opened, the command is run, and the window is closed checking for a binary needs multiple system commands to find the file and then check it which causes \u0026ldquo;flickering windows\u0026rdquo;. If the flickering windows is too disturbing a lua preference is available in the settings to use the old check_if_bin_exists(). The old check_if_bin_exists() still causes flickering windows but it\u0026rsquo;s much less. The downside is that no searching is performed so the user has to specify the location of all executables.\n🔗CHANGELOG 20201225 - Added search capability and file checking to ensure it\u0026rsquo;s an executable - Merry Christmas\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.api.manual/dtutils.file/check_if_bin_exists/","tags":null,"title":"check_if_bin_exists"},{"categories":null,"content":"🔗NAME check_min_api_version\n🔗SYNOPSIS check the minimum required application programming interface (API) version against the current API version\n🔗USAGE local du = require \u0026#34;lib/dtutils\u0026#34; local result = du.check_min_api_version(min_api, script_name) min_api - string - the API version that the application was written for (example: \u0026ldquo;5.0.0\u0026rdquo;)\nscript_name - string - the name of the script\n🔗DESCRIPTION check_min_api_version compares the minimum API required for the application to run against the current API version.

If you use one of these packages and wish to use the lua scripts, please contact the package maintainer and suggest the above fixes.\n🔗Linux and MacOS Ensure git is installed on your system.

Git can be obtained from https://gitforwindows.org/, as well as other places.

The file is a plain text file with entries of the form require \u0026quot;\u0026lt;directory\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;\u0026quot; where directory is the directory containing the scripts, from the above list, and name is the name from the above list. To include GIMP the line would be require \u0026quot;contrib/gimp\u0026quot;.\nThe recommended way to enable and disable specific scripts is using the script manager module. To use script manager do the following:\n🔗Linux or MacOS echo 'require \u0026quot;tools/script_manager\u0026quot;' \u0026gt; ~/.config/darktable/luarc 🔗Windows ( via command prompt ) echo require \u0026quot;tools/script_manager\u0026quot;

It takes a text file (In our case a Lua file) and recognises a few (language dependant) keyword in there. It matches those keywords with internal description on how functions are called and creates the .po file accordingly. (For example, it knows that the first argument of gettext() is the translated string, but that it\u0026rsquo;s the second argument for dgettext) This is important because it means that if you use some neat Lua tricks (like renaming functions) xgettext won\u0026rsquo;t recognize those calls and won\u0026rsquo;t extract the string to the .po file. So, this is why we create a local variagle gettext = dt.gettext, so xgettext recognises gettext.gettext as a function but not dt.gettext.gettext\nTo create a .mo file run: msgfmt -v gettextExample.po -o gettextExample.mo\n🔗Usage start this script from script manager copy the gettextExample.mo to .config/darktable/lua/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES You need to start darktable with the Lua debug option: darktable -d lua $LANG must set to: de_DE\nThe script run on darktable startup and should output this three lines:\nLUA ERROR Hello World!

Scripts are sorted by \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; based on what sub-directory they are in. With no additional script repositories iinstalled, the categories are contrib, examples, official and tools. When a category is selected the buttons show the script name and whether the script is started or stopped. The button is a toggle, so if the script is stopped click the button to start it and vice versa.\n🔗Features the number of script buttons shown can be changed to any number between 5 and 20. The default is 10 buttons. This can be changed in the configuration action.\nadditional repositories of scripts may be installed from the install/update action.\ninstalled scripts can be updated from the install/update action. This includes extra repositories that have been installed.\nthe lua scripts can be disabled if desired from the install/update action.\nscript_manager is automatically installed and enabled when the lua scripts are installed by the darktable scripts_installer.\n🔗Usage start/stop scripts -\nThe top part of the window has the category selector. The category corresponds to the directory that the scripts are in. Currently the categories are contrib for community contributed scripts, examples for example scripts, official for developer contributed scripts, and tools containing tools for managing the lua scripts. The lower part of the window contains the paged interface for the scripts contained in the selected category. There are arrow buttons for navigating the pages and an indicator showing what the current page is and how many pages of scripts there are for the current category. The number of buttons defaults to 10, but is configurable anywhere between 5 and 20 depending on how much screen real estate you want to use. The scripts are sorted alphabetically. The button shows the name of the script and it\u0026rsquo;s current status, started or stopped. Clicking the script button toggles the script from started to stopped and back again. configure - this window allows changing the number of buttons used to display scripts. Move the slider to select the number of buttons, click the change number of buttons button and the number of buttons will change and the action will change back to the start/stop scripts window.\ninstall/update scripts - This window allows installing additional script repositories and updating installed repositories.\nupdate - select the scripts to update from the scripts to update dropdown. Click the update scripts button to do the update.\ninstall - additional script repositories can be added to your lua scripts. To add another repository fill in the URL to download additional scripts from and then fill in the new category to place scripts in. Click the install additional scripts button and the category (directory) is created and a git clone is performed to retrieve the git repository. EXAMPLE: fill in URL to download additional scripts from with https://github.com/wpferguson/extra-dt-lua-scripts.git and the new category to place scripts in with wpferguson. Click the button to install the scripts. The scripts are retrieved and added to the user interface and the window changes to the newly installed script category.\ndisable scripts - the lua scripts are installed by the darktable scripts installer. If you install them and later decide you no longer want them cluttering up your user interface, this option can disable them and stop them from starting. Once they are disabled, the way to enable them again is to rename a file using the terminal and command line. To disable the scritps first click the checkbox to enable the Disable Scripts button. This is to prevent accidentally disabling the lua scripts. Once the Disable Scripts button is active, click it to disable the scripts. When the button is clicked, the luarc file is renamed to luarc.disabled which results in the scripts not starting the next time darktable starts.\n🔗Additional Software Required git - git-scm.com - git is used to install and update the scripts. script_manager will still run if git is not installed or accessible, but installing and updating scripts will not be possible.\n🔗Limitations There isn\u0026rsquo;t currently a way to stop an executing script and remove it from the interface, so when a script is stopped the script preference is set to not start the next time darktable starts.\nIf the scripts are disabled by choice the only way to enable them is by renaming the file luarc.disabled to luarc. Then file is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s darktable configuration directory, $HOME/.config/darktable on linux and macos and %LOCALAPPDATA%\\darktable on windows.\n🔗Author Bill Ferguson \u0026lt;wpferguson@gmail.com\u0026gt;\n🔗Change Log 20201225 - Rewrite for darktable 3.4 - Merry Christmas\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.manual/scripts/tools/script_manager/","tags":null,"title":"script_manager"},{"categories":null,"content":"🔗NAME tracepoint\n🔗SYNOPSIS print out a tracepoint and dump the arguments\n🔗USAGE local dd = require \u0026#34;lib/dtutils.debug\u0026#34; local result = dd.tracepoint(name, ...) name - string - the name of the tracepoint to print out\n\u0026hellip; - arguments - variables to dump the contents of\n🔗DESCRIPTION tracepoint prints its name and dumps its parameters using darktable.debug.\n🔗RETURN VALUE result - \u0026hellip; - the supplied argument list\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.api.manual/dtutils.debug/tracepoint/","tags":null,"title":"tracepoint"},{"categories":null,"content":"🔗Name cr2hdr.lua - Magic Lantern Dual ISO processing\n🔗Description cr2hdr Magic Lantern Dual ISO processing.\nThis script automates the steps involved to process an image created with the Magic Lantern Dual ISO module.

This corrects for a DR100/DR200/DR400 \u0026ldquo;dynamic range\u0026rdquo; setting.\nBased upon fujifilm_ratings by Ben Mendis\nThe relevant tag is RawExposureBias (0x9650). This appears to represent the shift in EV for the chosen DR setting (whether manual or automatic). Note that even at 100DR (\u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo;) there is an EV shift:\n100 DR -\u0026gt; -0.72 EV 200 DR -\u0026gt; -1.72 EV 400 DR -\u0026gt; -2.72 EV\nThe ideal would be to use exiv2 to read this tag, as this is the same code which darktable import uses. Unfortunately, exiv2 as of v0.27.3 can\u0026rsquo;t read this tag. As it is encoded as a 4-byte ratio of two signed shorts \u0026ndash; a novel data type \u0026ndash; it will require some attention to fix this.\nThere is an exiv2-readable DevelopmentDynamicRange tag which maps to RawExposureBias as above. DevelopmentDynamicRange is only present when tag DynamicRangeSetting (0x1402) is Manual/Raw (0x0001). When it is Auto (0x0000), the equivalent data is tag AutoDynamicRange (0x140b). But exiv2 currently can\u0026rsquo;t read that tag either.\nHence for now this code uses exiftool to read RawExposureBias, as a more general solution. As exiftool is approx. 10x slower than exiv2 (Perl vs. C++), this may slow large imports.\nThese tags have been checked on a Fujifilm X100S and X100V. Other cameras may behave in other ways.\n🔗Usage Start this script from script manager\n🔗Additional Software Required exiftool (https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)\n🔗Limitations 🔗Author Dan Torop dant@pnym.net\n🔗Change Log ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.manual/scripts/contrib/fujifilm_dynamic_range/","tags":null,"title":"fujifilm_dynamic_range"},{"categories":null,"content":"The image-filter menus at the top of the UI\nAttributes:\nhas_tostring parent : types.dt_lua_lib_t 🔗darktable.gui.libs.filter.sort function( [sort : types.dt_collection_sort_t] ) : types.dt_collection_sort_t Change the collection sort field.\n[sort] - types.dt_collection_sort_t - The new field to sort by.

The adjustment can be added or subtracted.\nWARNING: When adding and subtracting months the result will usually be what is expected unless the time being adjusted is at the end of the month. This is because a month is a variable amount of time that can be 28, 29, 30 or 31 days depending on the month. Example: It\u0026rsquo;s March 31st and I subtract a month which not sets the time to February 31st.

This is useful when importing scanned images that don\u0026rsquo;t have an embedded date.\n🔗SYNCHRONIZE TIME I recently purchased a 7DmkII to replace my aging 7D. My 7D was still serviceable, so I bought a remote control and figured I\u0026rsquo;d try shooting events from 2 different perspectives. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think to synchonize the time between the 2 cameras, so when I loaded the images and sorted by time it was a disaster. I hacked a script together with hard coded values to adjust the exif_datetime_taken value in the database for the 7D images so that everything sorted properly. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried shooting with 2 cameras several times since that first attempt. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten better at getting the camera times close, but still haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to get them to sync.

Those wanting to move or copy images from a hierarchy of directories within darktable while preserving the directory structure, must take the laborious step of performing the operation one individual directory at a time.\nThis module allows the intact moving and copying of whole directory trees. It was designed for the specific use case of rapidly transferring images from a customary source (e.g., a staging directory on the local disk) to a customary destination (e.g., a directory on a NAS device).\n🔗Instructions for operation: Select the set of images you want to copy.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;calculate\u0026rdquo; button. This will calculate the lowest directory in the hierarchy that contains every selected file (i.e., the common prefix of all the images\u0026rsquo; pathnames), and write its path into the \u0026ldquo;existing root\u0026rdquo; text box.\nIf (a) you have specified the \u0026ldquo;customary source root\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;customary destination root\u0026rdquo; preferences, and (b) the selected images are all contained under the directory specified as the customary source root, then the \u0026ldquo;root of destination\u0026rdquo; text box will also be automatically filled out.\nFor example, suppose that you have specified \u0026lsquo;/home/user/Staging\u0026rsquo; as your customary source root and \u0026lsquo;/mnt/storage\u0026rsquo; as your customary destination root. If all selected images fell under the directory \u0026lsquo;/home/user/Staging/2020/Roll0001\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026ldquo;root of destination\u0026rdquo; would be automatically filled out with \u0026lsquo;/mnt/storage/2020/Roll0001\u0026rsquo;.\nBut if all selected images fall under a directory outside the specified customary source root (e.g., \u0026lsquo;/opt/other\u0026rsquo;), the \u0026ldquo;root of destination\u0026rdquo; text box must be filled out manually.\nIt is also possible to edit the \u0026ldquo;root of destination\u0026rdquo; further once it has been automatically filled out.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;move\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;copy\u0026rdquo; button.\nBefore moving or copying any images, the module will first replicate the necessary directory hierarchy by creating all destination directories that do not already exist; should a directory creation attempt fail, the operation will be aborted, but any directories already created will not be removed.\nDuring the actual move/copy operation, the module transfers an image by taking its path and replacing the string in the \u0026ldquo;existing root\u0026rdquo; text box with that in the \u0026ldquo;root of destination\u0026rdquo; text box (e.g., \u0026lsquo;/home/user/Staging/2020/Roll0001/DSC_0001.jpg\u0026rsquo; would be transferred to \u0026lsquo;/mnt/storage/2020/Roll0001/DSC_0001.jpg\u0026rsquo;).\n🔗Additional Software Required 🔗Limitations 🔗Author August Schwerdfeger - august@schwerdfeger.name\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.manual/scripts/contrib/transfer_hierarchy/","tags":null,"title":"transfer_hierarchy"},{"categories":null,"content":"🔗Name ultrahdr.lua - Generate Ultra HDR JPEG images from various combinations of source images.\n🔗Description The plugin generates Ultra HDR images that embed intents targetting both SDR and HDR displays in one JPEG file. UltraHDR images can be generated from the following sources (stacks):\nSDR + gain map SDR + HDR SDR only HDR only The output images use PQ P3 RGB color profile for the HDR intent, and Display P3 RGB for the SDR intent.\n🔗Usage Install the script. Require this script from your luarc file or start it from script_manager, and configure paths for the required binaries if they are not on the path.\nPrepare the source image(s). Depending on the selected workflow, you will need a combination of the following versions of each photo (with the same pixel dimensions):\nStandard dynamic-range (SDR) image High-dynamic range (HDR) image, e.g. created using darktable\u0026rsquo;s HDR merge workflows, or externally. Single channel gain map (a map indicating how much to brighten each pixel, in the SDR image, to produce the target HDR). You can create it by e.g. duplicating the SDR image, converting it to monochrome, and using the tone equalizer module to increase the contrast. Tag all source HDR images with hdr tag, and gain map images with gainmap tag. This is so the plugin correctly recognizes the source images when merging.\nSelect source image(s) in lighttable. To generate a single Ultra HDR JPEG, simply select all its source images. To generate multiple Ultra HDR JPEGs, make sure that the source images for a given Ultra JPEG all have the same file path and file name (ignoring extension), as that\u0026rsquo;s how the plugin recognizes spearate source image \u0026lsquo;stacks\u0026rsquo;. You can use darktable\u0026rsquo;s duplicate image function for that.\nConfigure the export. Review the export parameters in the UltraHDR module in lighttable.\nGenerate UltraHDR.

Obtain this by building or installing the binary through package managers. exiftool ffmpeg 🔗Limitations darktable is currently not able to properly display HDR content (#17710). For HDR source images, adjust exposure of the HDR images before generating Ultra HDRs. This usually means adding an exposure module with -5.6 EV correction to HDR image (it should appear as very dark in darktable UI). See this thread for details.\nDue to that limitation, an expected rendition of UltraHDR images usually takes a few tries, and the output images need to be previewed in a HDR-capable display and application (e.g. a Chromium-based browser).\n🔗Author Krzysztof Kotowicz\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.manual/scripts/contrib/ultrahdr/","tags":null,"title":"ultrahdr"},{"categories":null,"content":"The session UI when tethering\nAttributes:\nhas_tostring parent : types.dt_lua_lib_t ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.api.manual/darktable/gui/libs/session/","tags":null,"title":"darktable.gui.libs.session"},{"categories":null,"content":"dt_type\nA lua-managed entry in the backgroundjob lib\n🔗dt_lua_backgroundjob_t.percent number\nThe value of the progress bar, between 0 and 1. will return nil if there is no progress bar, will raise an error if read or written on an invalid job\nAttributes:\nwrite 🔗dt_lua_backgroundjob_t.valid boolean\nTrue if the job is displayed, set it to false to destroy the entry An invalid job cannot be made valid again\nAttributes:\nwrite ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.api.manual/types/dt_lua_backgroundjob_t/","tags":null,"title":"dt_lua_backgroundjob_t"},{"categories":null,"content":"🔗Name video_ffmpeg.lua - create a timelapse video from selected images\n🔗Description This plugin will add the new export module \u0026ldquo;video ffmpeg\u0026rdquo;.\n🔗Usage Go to Lighttable Select images you want to use as a video ffmpeg frames In image export module select \u0026ldquo;video ffmpeg\u0026rdquo; Configure you video settings Export 🔗Additional Software Required ffmpeg\n🔗Limitations This script has been tested under Linux only\n🔗Author Dominik Markiewicz\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","href":"/luadocs/lua.scripts.manual/scripts/contrib/video_ffmpeg/","tags":null,"title":"video_ffmpeg"},{"categories":null,"content":"The UI element that manipulates snapshots in darkroom\nAttributes:\nhas_tostring parent : types.dt_lua_lib_t 🔗darktable.gui.libs.snapshots.ratio number - The place in the screen where the line separating the snapshot is.
